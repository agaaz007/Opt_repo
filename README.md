This project focuses on building a comprehensive machine learning framework to analyze and predict various meal-related patterns. 
The scripts address specific meal times (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) using robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.
By combining domain-specific insights with machine learning, the project aims to optimize meal planning, reduce waste, and enhance operational efficiency.
